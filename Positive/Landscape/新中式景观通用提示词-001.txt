A traditional Chinese-style building, set in a lush and natural setting. The building is made of red brick and wood, with a tiled roof and intricate carvings on the facade. It's surrounded by tall bamboo, flowering shrubs, and vibrant flowers blooming in the garden. A stone path leads to the entrance, and there's a wooden fence surrounding the property. The sky is clear and blue, with a few puffy clouds floating by. (best quality,4k,8k,highres,masterpiece:1.2),ultra-detailed,(realistic,photorealistic:1.37)
